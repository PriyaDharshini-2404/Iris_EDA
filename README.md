# 🌸 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Iris Dataset

This project was completed as part of my **Codveda Data Science Internship**.  
The goal was to explore the famous **Iris flower dataset** using Python and visualize its features to gain insights before applying machine learning models.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **Dataset**: Iris Flower Dataset
- **Samples**: 150
- **Features**:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- **Target**: Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

---

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Load and clean the dataset
- Perform summary statistics and check for missing values
- Explore relationships between features using visualizations
- Identify patterns useful for classification models

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

---

## 📊 Key Outputs & Visual Insights

✅ **Head of Dataset**  
Shows first 5 rows with proper column names and 150 entries. No missing values were found.

✅ **Summary Statistics**  
Revealed clear differences in mean petal length and width across species.

✅ **Correlation Heatmap**  
Petal length and petal width had a **strong positive correlation (~0.96)**. Sepal features were weakly correlated.

✅ **Boxplots**  
- Petal length and petal width had strong species-wise separation
- Sepal width showed more overlapping between species

✅ **Histograms**  
- Petal width and length distributions clearly separated Setosa from others
- Sepal dimensions were more evenly distributed

✅ **Pairplot** (colored by species)  
- Setosa was completely separable from Versicolor and Virginica
- Versicolor and Virginica had some overlap, but still distinct in petal length/width

## 🔍 Final Insights

- 🔸 **No missing values** found
- 🔸 **Petal dimensions** are highly discriminative for classification
- 🔸 **Setosa** is linearly separable from other species
- 🔸 Dataset is balanced and ideal for testing classification models
